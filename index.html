        <h4>About Lions</h4>
        <p>The lion, often called the King of the Jungle, is a symbol of strength, courage, and leadership. Known for
            their majestic presence and fearless demeanor, lions are one of nature's most powerful creatures. They live
            in prides, where teamwork and loyalty ensure survival, making them not just rulers but also exemplary team
            players. This webpage draws inspiration from the lion’s traits to motivate you to face life’s challenges
            with confidence and determination.</p>
